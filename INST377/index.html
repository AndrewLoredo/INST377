		<p> My professional goal is to create and write stories within the medium of digital media such as animation or video games. 
		The photo above is a pixel art rendition that I created of a character from the anime "Megalobox". This was created as a pin design for a friend 
		who runs an anime pin store and it emphasizes my love for "Megalobox", an anime that has helped influence my storytelling, and pixel art, something
		that I have practiced to tell the stories I want to tell through animation and/or video games. </p>
